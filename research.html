                      <h2>Galaxies and their Supermassive Black Holes in the early Universe</h2>
                  </header>
                  <p> My main scientific interest lies in the to understand the emergence of galaxies in the early
                      Universe. I am particularly interested in the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHS), which we can observe
                      during phases of active growth (mass accretion), when they shine as luminous quasars.
                      My group studies quasars in the first two billion years of the Universe to understand the
                      processes by which SMBHs form, how they grow to their observed masses and how they influence the evolution of their host galaxies.
                      The first massive SMBHs are believed to reside in the most overdense regions of the Cosmic Web and observations of these environments allow us to test large-scale structure formation models.
                      Furthermore, quasars serve as bright beacons to study hydrogen reionization, the last major phase transition of the Universe, in absorption.

						<h2>The search for the most distant quasars</h2>
						<p>
						To understand the formation of supermassive black holes my group expands the quasar redshift
                            frontier using near-infrared, wide-area photometric surveys.
                        Applying careful completeness analyses we can statistically constrain the quasar number densities to understand the emergence of the first SMBHs.

                        The Euclid space mission, launched in 2023, and the Vera Rubin Observatory with its Legacy Survey of Space and Time, will provide the deepest optical and near-infrared surveys
                        of the extragalactic sky. These surveys will allow us to discover quasars up to redshifts of
                            ~10 to truly understand their formation processes and early growth. My group works on
                            developing new quasar selection strategies tailored to these surveys to build the first census of the most distant quasars.

						<h2>Characterization of supermassive black holes</h2>
						<p>
                            Spectroscopic follow-up observations of quasars are not only essential to measure the mass of the SMBH and to understand the physics of the accretion process.
                            The spectra also allow us to investigate the chemical make-up of the accreted gas and provide insight into foreground galaxies as well as the state of the
                            intergalactic medium.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I have been leading one of the largest spectroscopic studies of high-redshift quasars, the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...51S/abstract"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                            X-SHOOTER/ALMA Survey of Quasars in the Epoch of Reionization</a>.
                            Based on this sample of 38 reionization-era quasars, z>5.7, we concluded that quasars at these times are <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941..106F/abstract"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accreting more rapidly than their lower-redshift
                            cousins</a>. In addition, the spectra more commonly show large velocity shifts of high-ionization lines, indicative of vigorous (outflowing) gas motion
                            close to the accretion disk. Even 0.8 Gyr after the Big Bang the accreted gas is already chemically enriched, indicating a fast chemical evolution
                            at the centers of these early massive galaxies.

                        <p>I am also a member of the  <a href="https://xqr30.inaf.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XQR-30 collaboration</a>,
                            which is centered on a large ESO/X-SHOOTER program to provide high signal-to-noise ratio spectra
                            of 30 quasars at z>5.7. This unprecedented data set has already led to some exciting results: in a study published in Nature, lead by Manuela Bischetti,
                            we show that <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Natur.605..244B/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> fast outflowing dense gas is observed at a much higher incidence </a>
                            in the first 1 Gyr after Big Bang, possibly indicating more vigorous feedback
                            effects on the surrounding galactic gas. We furthermore use these spectra to understand the evolution and morphology of cosmic hydrogen reionization.
                            By measuring the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514...55B/abstract"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lyman-&alpha; transmission </a>

                            we were able to conclude that the epoch of reionization extends to z~5.3,
                            later than originally thought.</p>

                        The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) opens up the near- and mid-infrared sky unhindered by the Earth's atmosphere.
                        It's unprecendent capabilities will revolutionize our understanding the population of less
                            luminous galaxies and lower mass supermassive black holes, which appear much fainter than quasars.

						<h2>Machine learning in Astrophysics</h2>
						<p>
						My group applies machine learning techniques to search for rare high-redshift quasar candidates
                            in large astronomical datasets. For source classification and photometric redshift
                            estimation (regression problem), we currently employ random forests, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Bayesian
                            neural networks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        However, at high redshift, z>6, we run into the problem that there is not sufficient empirical
                            training data available for the rare luminous quasars we are interested in. Therefore, we are currently developing
                            a generative model based on a Variational Autoencoder that can produce synthetic quasar
                            spectra. Trained on a large sample of lower-redshift quasars, this model will allow us
                            to calculate synthetic photometry based on the spectra and reconstruct quasar spectra with
                            missing spectral coverage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I am further interested to explore the vast data sets of the Euclid mission and the Vera C. Rubin
                        Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) to search for rare and exotic objects with
                        unsupervised machine learning methods.
