                  <p> My research focuses on the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe.
                    In this context I aim to understand the processes by which SMBHs form, how they grow to their observed masses and how they influence the evolution of their host galaxies.
                    I also use these quasars as probes of the early Universe to study the formation of cosmic structures and the evolution of the intergalactic medium.</p>

						<h2>The search for the most distant quasars</h2>
						<p>
						To understand the formation of supermassive black holes I am searching for the most distant quasars using near-infrared, wide-area photometric surveys.
                        Applying careful completeness analyses we can statistically constrain the quasar number densities to understand the emergence of the first SMBHs.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Euclid space mission, to be launched in 2023, and the Vera Rubin Observatory with its Legacy Survey of Space and Time, will provide the deepest optical and near-infrared surveys
                        of the extragalactic sky. These surveys will allow us to discover quasars up to redshifts of 10 to truly understand their formation processes and early growth.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        My future group and I work on developing new quasar selection strategies tailored to these surveys to build the first census of the most distant quasars.
                        </p>
                        <p>In past work I have designed and executed the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...851...13S/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extremely Luminous Quasar Survey (ELQS)</a>

                            another 55 quasars. Based on these number counts, we have presented <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...943...67S/abstract"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most precise estimate of the z~6 quasar luminosity function</a>.</p>

						<h2>Characterization of supermassive black holes</h2>
						<p>
                            Spectroscopic follow-up observations of quasars are not only essential to measure the mass of the SMBH and to understand the physics of the accretion process.
                            The spectra also allow us to investigate the chemical make-up of the accreted gas and provide insight into foreground galaxies as well as the state of the
                            intergalactic medium.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I have been leading one of the largest spectroscopic studies of high-redshift quasars, the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...51S/abstract"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                            X-SHOOTER/ALMA Survey of Quasars in the Epoch of Reionization</a>.
                            Based on this sample of 38 reionization-era quasars, z>5.7, we concluded that quasars at these times are <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941..106F/abstract"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accreting more rapidly than their lower-redshift
                            cousins</a>. In addition, the spectra more commonly show large velocity shifts of high-ionization lines, indicative of vigorous (outflowing) gas motion
                            close to the accretion disk. Even 0.8 Gyr after the Big Bang the accreted gas is already chemically enriched, indicating a fast chemical evolution
                            at the centers of these early massive galaxies.
						</p>
                        <p>I am also a member of the  <a href="https://xqr30.inaf.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XQR-30 collaboration</a>,
                            which is centered on a large ESO/X-SHOOTER program to provide high signal-to-noise ratio spectra
                            of 30 quasars at z>5.7. This unprecedented data set has already led to some exciting results: in a study published in Nature, lead by Manuela Bischetti,
                            we show that <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Natur.605..244B/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fast outflowing dense gas is observed at a much higher incidence </a>
                            in the first 1 Gyr after Big Bang, possibly indicating more vigorous feedback
                            effects on the surrounding galactic gas. We furthermore use these spectra to understand the evolution and morphology of cosmic hydrogen reionization.
                            By measuring the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514...55B/abstract"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lyman-&alpha; transmission </a>
                            and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..223Z/abstract" >"dark gaps" in the Lyman-&alpha; forest</a>, we were able to conclude that the epoch of reionization extends to z~5.3,
                            later than originally thought.</p>

						<h2>Machine learning in Astrophysics</h2>
						<p>
						I apply machine learning techniques to search for rare high-redshift quasar candidates in large
                            astronomical datasets. For source classification and photometric redshift estimation (regression problem),
                            I employ:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Random Forests</li>
                                <li>Support Vector Machines</li>
                                <li>Bayesian Neural Networks</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        However, machine learning algorithms can also be useful to generate <b>model</b> quasar spectra to constrain
                            survey selection functions or to measure physical properties. With my new group I am to build a
                            new quasar spectral model with the help of one or more of the following algorithms:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Variational Autoencoders</li>
                            <li>Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
